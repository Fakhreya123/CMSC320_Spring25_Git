Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that lets programmers monitor codebase modifications, which helps them better comprehend how the code changes over time.
By enabling developers to work on distinct branches, it promotes feature isolation and keeps the stable version of the code uninterrupted.
Additionally, Git facilitates easy cooperation between developers by allowing each person to work on their own copy of the code while monitoring the contributions of other developers.
Git facilitates efficient review and merging of changes, improving code quality and teamwork.
Git also provides strong capabilities for managing version history, resolving disputes, and facilitating remote cooperation.
Developers can go back to earlier iterations if needed because each commit is tracked with a unique ID.
Teams can work on separate features and then effortlessly integrate them thanks to Git's branching and merging capabilities.
All things considered, Git is a crucial tool for collaboration, code change management, and upholding an organized development process.

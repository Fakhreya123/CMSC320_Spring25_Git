Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that lets programmers monitor codebase modifications, which helps them better comprehend how the code changes over time.
By enabling developers to work on distinct branches, it promotes feature isolation and keeps the stable version of the code uninterrupted.
Additionally, Git facilitates easy cooperation between developers by allowing each person to work on their own copy of the code while monitoring the contributions of other developers.
Git facilitates efficient review and merging of changes, improving code quality and teamwork.
Git also provides strong capabilities for managing version history, resolving disputes, and facilitating remote cooperation.
Developers can go back to earlier iterations if needed because each commit is tracked with a unique ID.
Teams can work on separate features and then effortlessly integrate them thanks to Git's branching and merging capabilities.
All things considered, Git is a crucial tool for collaboration, code change management, and upholding an organized development process.


Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Numerous industries, including marketing, banking, healthcare, and even sports, can benefit from the use of data science. Data scientists can find patterns, forecast outcomes,
and streamline decision-making by utilizing statistical modeling, machine learning, and data analysis. Data science, for instance, can be applied in the healthcare industry to forecast
patient outcomes using past medical records. Data scientists can assist in identifying people who are more susceptible to specific diseases by examining medical histories, patient records,
and lifestyle factors. This enables early intervention and individualized treatment approaches.
This use of data science can result in more effective healthcare systems and better patient care.
